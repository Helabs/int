# vim: set ft=yaml:
# Int settings
#
# This file is where your settings live.
# For all environments, the defaults are these:
#  bundle: true
#  database_tasks: 'db:migrate db:seed'
#  run_tests: true
#  use_tags: false
#  minimum_coverage: true
#  migrate_locally: true
#  branch: master
#
#
#For staging (the default environment):
#
#  app: my-app-staging
#
#For production (when you run `int run production`):
#
#  app: my-app-production
#  branch: production
#  use_tags: true
#
#
# Each of these settings can be setup with the following (defaults right below it):
#
# "branch" can be set to false or a string.
# If branch is set to false, the setting will be ignored.
# If set to a string, we will always check which branch you're in before integrating.
# Default is master for staging and production for production.
#
# branch: master
#
#
# minimum_coverage can be either true, a number, or false.
# When set to false, it will just ignore your coverage settings.
# When set to true, it will check if your spec/spec_helper.rb is set to fail
# if code coverage is not 100%
# When set to a number, we will check if your spec/spec_helper.rb is set to
# that specific number.
#
# minimum_coverage: true
#
#
# bundle can be either true or false. If set to false,
# "bundle install" will be skipped.
#
# bundle: true
#
#
# migrate_locally will run rake db:migrate test:prepare if set to true.
#
# migrate_locally: true
#
#
# run_tests can be either, true, false, an array or a string.
# If set to false, tests will be skipped (not recommended unless you know what you are doing).
# If set to true, it will run "rspec spec".
# If set to an array or string, the command(s) will be ran.
#
# run_tests: true
#
#
# use_tags is useful for deploying to production.
# When set to true, a tag will be generated with the format
# "#{environment}-#{Time.now.strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H%M%S')}".
#
# use_tags: false
#
#
# database_tasks are what rake tasks will be run on the server after deploying.
# It is currently limited to rake tasks and can accept a string or an array:
#
# database_tasks:
#   - "db:migrate"
#   - "db:seed"
# or:
# database_tasks: "db:migrate db:seed"
#
# database_tasks:
#   - "db:migrate"
#   - "db:seed"
#
# It can be disabled by setting it to false.
#
# It can be disabled by setting it to false.
#
# You should change the settings below.
#
# That's it! Have fun!
